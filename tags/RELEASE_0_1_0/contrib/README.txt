JSMin & JSMin Ant Task
======================

JSMin is:
  "a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace from JavaScript
   files. It typically reduces filesize by half, resulting in faster downloads.
   It also encourages a more expressive programming style because it eliminates
   the download cost of clean, literate self-documentation."

JSMin is developed by Douglas Crockford and is released under Apache
